# Code Quiz
## Description
In this homework assignment I created a timed quiz with 3 sets of questions protaining to javascript. It must contain highscores that can be entered and saved to local stoarage, a 60 second timer that will stop the game when it runs out, and questions that will prompt you as to whether you have answered them right or wrong. If you answer a question wrong then 10 seconds will be deducted from your timer.
